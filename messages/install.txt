You just installed SublimeLinter-addon-black-for-flake
------------------------------------------------------

- Make sure you have SublimeLinter-flake8 (https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-flake8) installed.
- Highly recommended is to install sublack (https://github.com/jgirardet/sublack) as well.

This addon will automatically filter all reported warnings `black` can actually
fix. It does this *only* for views for which `"sublack.black_on_save": true` 
or `"SublimeLinter-addon-black-for-flake.enable": true` has been configured. 
(Which keys it evaluates can itself be configured via the settings, but you probably don't need to.)

Typically, at least as long as `black` is not the default in the python community, you set this in your project file. Like so:

```json
{
    "folders": [
        {
            "path": "."
        },
    ],

    "settings": {
        "sublack.black_on_save": true
    }
}
```

for specific projects. 

`sublack` allows you to switch black on or off temporarily per view, e.g. via the context menu. These views will get selected or deselected automatically as well.

If you ever want this to be enabled by default, you could also set it up in your User Preferences.
